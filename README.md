# MATLABAssistant
MATLAB Assistant is a voice assistant tool that helps to perform predefined activities within MATLAB/Simulink.

This utility is developed to share an idea of developing a voice assisted automation tool for MATLAB. Also, to introduce Speech Recognition modules available freely within Python which can be used from MATLAB.

Pre-requisite:
1. MATLAB version 2015b and above.
2. Python version 3.8
Note: Please note that the Python is installed and added to the system path. Also the following modules are installed within Python.
1. SpeechRecognition
2. playsound
3. gTTS
4. pyaudio

Usage:

The user may install the MATLABAssistant.mlappinstall which is available under the utils folder. Once installed, the app "MATLAB Assistant" becomes visible under APPS Tab.

The following predefined commands can be given as voice input to use the MATLAB Assistant.

* 'hey','hi','hello' for greetings.
* 'what is your name','what's your name','tell me your name' for getting app name.
* 'my name is (username)' to tell user name.
* 'how are you','how are you doing' for greetings.
* 'what's the time','tell me the time','what time is it' to know the time.
* 'search web for (search word)' to search anything in web.
* 'search youtube for (search word)' to search anything in youtube.
* 'help (inbuilt function)' to get the documentation for the inbuilt function in command window.
* 'search documentation for (search word)' to search anything in MATLAB documentation.
* 'clear base workspace' to clear the base workspace.
* 'clear command window screen' to clear the command window screen.
* 'open script as (script name)' to open a new script or an existing script with name as (script name).
* 'run matlab script (script name)' to run the given script as input.
* 'run active matlab script' to run the active MATLAB script in the editor window.
* 'open simulink' to open Simulink starting window.
* 'open simulink library browser' to open Simulink Library Browser.
* 'open new system' to open a Simulink system.
* 'open system (system name)' to open the Simulink system given as input.
* 'simulate system (system name)' to simulate the Simulink system given as input.
* 'simulate active system' to simulate the active Simulink system.
* 'about matlab assistant' to open the MATLAB Assistant document.
* 'exit matlab' to close the MATLAB window.
* 'exit', 'quit', 'goodbye' to exit the MATLAB Assistant.
